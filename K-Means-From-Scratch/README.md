# Unsupervised learning

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

- **Algorithmic Analysis K-Means Clustering with Real World Dataset**

Download a simulated dataset: kmeans_data.zip from Modules->Datasets. Then,
implement the K-means algorithm from scratch. K-means algorithm computes the distance of a
given data point pair. Replace the distance computation function with Euclidean distance, 1-
Cosine similarity, and 1 – the Generalized Jarcard similarity (refer to:
https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/software/dataplot/refman2/auxillar/jaccard.htm).

-  Run K-means clustering with Euclidean, Cosine and Jarcard similarity.

- Compare the accuracies of Euclidean-K-means Cosine-K-means, Jarcard-K-means.

- Set up the same stop criteria: “when there is no change in centroid position OR when the SSE value increases in the next iteration OR when the maximum preset value

-  Compare the SSEs of Euclidean-K-means Cosine-K-means, Jarcard-K-means with respect to the following three terminating conditions: 
    - when there is no change in centroid position
    - when the SSE value increases in the next iteration
    - when the maximum preset value (e.g., 100) of iteration is complete
